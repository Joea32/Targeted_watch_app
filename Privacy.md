##  Privacy & Data Security

This app is built with community safety in mind. We currently:
- Do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what’s entered voluntarily.
- Store check-in data securely, with plans to integrate end-to-end encryption.
- Do not share or sell user data.
- Plan to add decentralized data logging in future versions.

We’re open to community input on improving transparency and security.
